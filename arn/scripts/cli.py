"""The Command Line Interface for scripts of the `arn` package.
This leverages the argparse submodules to provide all the scripts as commands
to one installed script, as is done with git:
```
    git --version
    git fetch
    git pull
    git push
```
Where `git` has its own commands along with submodules that have their own
specific commands, such as fetch, pull, and push.
